# Monte Carlo Simulator for Packet Collision Probability of Direct-to-Satellite IoT Systems

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the LoRa and LR-FHSS MATLAB Monte Carlo simulators used in 

*E. Testi and E. Paolini, “Packet Collision Probability of Direct-to-Satellite IoT Systems,” IEEE Internet of Things Journal, under review.*

and

*E. Testi and E. Paolini, “Packet collision probability analysis in contention-based direct-to-satellite IoT uplink,” Proc. 2024 IEEE Int. Symp. Pers. Indoor Mob. Radio Commun., accepted.*

The simulators are designed to validate the analytical models presented in the papers by comparing them against extensive network simulations.
